# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2: ETL
During this project, several of the skills learnt so far were used, such as, Python, Pandas, ELT, and SQL. 
For this project, 2 excel files: crowdfunding and contacts were provided. 
The requirements were to generate four csv files by using data from the above two files. 
The four csv files generated were then used to generate an ERD (Entity Relationship diagram) using www.quickdatabasediagrams.com
The primary keys and functional keys were defined. The schema and the ERD was downloaded. 
The schema was uploaded in pgAdmin4 to define table structures. The tables were then imported in the specific order and queried to test the accurate import of data. 
The files provided in this project are:
- category.csv
- subcategory.csv
- contacts.csv
- campaign.csv
- ERD_crowdfunding.png (ERD diagram)
- crowdfunding_db_schema
- ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code_HGumber (jupyter notebook with code)
